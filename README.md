# Stream Transform Task

## I can't clone your git repository,, So I have tried to do a project like you.

1. Firstly, I have created a origin server named mainServer. There I put some demo data and My secrect code is "I love Bangladesh"

2. Secondly, I have created the chalange file and here I have tried to write your task.

3. Finally, I have created a test file for testing the data from the client side. (I am a windows user)

### To Run the code:
    ** node mainServer.mjs **
    ** node challange.mjs **
    ** test.mjs **
